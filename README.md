# Machine Learning

This repository contains code for common machine learning algorithms.  I am writing these algorithms from scratch to get a better understanding of how they "really" work.

Currently under development:
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression

Planned:
- Support vector machines
- Artificial neural networks
- Decision trees/random forrests

The goal is to have a Jupyter notebook to go along with each algorithm that demonstrates its use and maybe some other interesting or useful related topic.  If you are new to data science, there may be some value in looking at the noteboks (for notes and use cases) *and* at the code for a stripped-down implementation.

Right now all code is written in Julia 0.5.  I was initially writing in Python but switched over to Julia for the practice.
