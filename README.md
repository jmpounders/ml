# Learning Machine Learning

This repository contains code for common machine learning algorithms.  I am writing these algorithms from scratch to get a better understanding of how they "really" work.

The goal is to have a Jupyter notebook to go along with each algorithm that demonstrates its use and maybe some other interesting or useful related topic.  If you are new to data science, there may be some value in looking at the noteboks (to see how the algorithms are used from a data perspective) *and* at the code for a stripped-down implementation.

Right now all code is written in Python 2.7 using numpy.  I will probably use sklearn to do some validation and comparison studies at some point.  I would like to implement some of this in Julia and R as well so that I can do some side-by-side comparisons and brush up on my Julia and R.
